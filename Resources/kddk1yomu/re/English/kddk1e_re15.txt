Back to the Forest@

The book closes and we say good bye to all of our curious forest friends.@
There are a few things which were delivered to my room from the forest...@

There is a striped letter A,@
a blue bird, @a helicopter, @a hamburger, @a mushroom coffee cup, @a train,@ 

a golden apple, @a sunflower, @a skateboard, @a potholder, @a globe,@
and finally, one colored pencil.@

Where is it?@

ItÅfs here!@
If we want to visit the forest again, @all we have to do is open the book.@
