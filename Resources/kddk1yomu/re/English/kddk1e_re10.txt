On Top of the Stairs@

I carefully climb the twisted, curving stairs one step at a time.@
Wait for me, Mookie!  @DonÅft run ahead so quickly.@

A moon and stars are near each other, @
and a cat and a fish make faces at each other.@

It looks like a bat, flew all this way to be here.@
ThereÅfs a red shoe.  @HereÅfs a yellow shoe.@

Uh-oh!  @Someone is about to eat the apple!  @The ladybug watches this.@
There is a white violin and a gold water spigot.@

Zoom!  @Both an airplane and an UFO make emergency landings.@
A bear makes a successful escape.@

Where is it?@

Mookie went into a room that smells delicious.@
