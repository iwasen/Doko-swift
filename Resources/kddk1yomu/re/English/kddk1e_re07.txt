The Gentle Mushrooms@

The mushrooms are all lit up.@
Thank you for guiding us along the path.@

There are two spools here and there.@
There are two buttons, two shovels and two coffee cups, too.@

There is a desk and three chairs, @a door and a key, @two ants and a dragonfly, @
an acorn and a pinecone.@

A black mushroom just flew in.  @Look at that fashionable mushroom with the hat.@
Even in the basket, the mushrooms sprout up.@

Where is it?@

ItÅfs starting to sprinkle, Mookie.@
LetÅfs go and get out of the rain.@
