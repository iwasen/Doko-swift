In the Middle of the Forest@

What appeared before my eyes was a shining castle.@
From the tall tower, you can see across the entire forest.@

There is a triangular window and a purple door.@
Here is a silver fork, and a white coffee cup.@

The round table has a parasol in the middle of it.@
Can you find the door with the polka-dots and the door with the stripes?@

Over there is an abandoned row boat.  @There goes a roly-poly ball.@
The sunflower faces towards us and looks like its smiling.@

Where is it?@

Mookie, what are you looking at?@
I sure would like to climb those stairs.@
