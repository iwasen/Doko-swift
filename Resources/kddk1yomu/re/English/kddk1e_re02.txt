Chasing After the Book@

The bookÅfs pages fly as ride the wind.@
Go after it, Mookie!@

Look for the numbers in order from one to seven.@
Say hello to the snowman.  @The shovel and bucket are right over there.@

There is a hanging tire.  @Here is a flying plane.@
Where are those two drawers hiding?  @There is a matching hat and glove.@

Here is a carrot, an onion and a potato.@
When you get tired, take a rest on the white bench.@

Can you find the letters A, B, C, D?@

Where is it?@

In the distance, I can see green tinged light coming through the trees.@
The forest is calling us.  @LetÅfs go!@
