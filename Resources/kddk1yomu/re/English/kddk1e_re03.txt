The Forest AnimalsÅf Welcome@

When we go through the canopy of leaves, @the animals come out to greet us.@
Welcome, they say to us with smiles.@

There is a deer, and here are two rabbits.  @Two squirrels kiss.@
Another squirrel holds an acorn tightly.@

A ladybug looks at the red berries.@
In the distance, there is the shape of a heart.@

A woodpecker tap-taps the tree, @and an owl flaps its wings.@
Oh dear!  @It looks as though a snake is ready to strike!@

Where is it?@

Hey,Mookie.@
You have a lot of fun friends in the forest.@
