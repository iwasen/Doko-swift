Drifting Up to the Sky@

All the things in this room get sucked up into the sky.@
ItÅfs as if that book beckons it all.@

All of the books jump off the shelves, @and an owl flies quickly away.@
A striped caterpillar crawls out, @and the butterfly escapes from its box.@

The skeleton chases after them with a net-@nice catch!@
The car takes off, @and the umbrella and the pencil still float.@

Mookie, be sure to hold on to somethingÅDÅDÅD@

Where is it?@

Now, I know, Mookie!@
It was my book in my room.@
