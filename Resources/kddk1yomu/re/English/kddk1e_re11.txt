The Cake that Flies through the Air@

That sweet smell comes from the kitchen.@
Try to catch the cakes which fly through the air.@

A hen lays its eggs.  @A wire whisk turns around and around.@
The cream squirts out from the pastry bag.  @How busy it is.@@What time is it?@

The steam shovel comes to help.@
Well, thatfs strange.  @Itfs a square strawberry.@

And the cherries are right over there.@
A pair of castanets and the trumpet will let you know when itfs all done.@

Where is it?@

Oh-watch out, Mookie!@
That is no place to fool around.@
