At the Top of the Tower@

This is the castle tower.  @Once we climbed up the long staircase, @
there were so many books lined up in a row.@

There is an old globe and an old microscope.@
Here is a blue pencil and a triangle.@

Would you like a snack?  @HereÅfs an apple and a banana.@
There is a pair of green rain boots and a yellow helmet.@

Invited by the soft sounds of a piano, @a turtle starts to move slowly.@
I would like to give that red ribbon to Mookie.@

Where is it?@

Just then, @one of the books floated upwards.@
